A project dedicated to me learning NodeJS 
w/ Express, building a REST API for an SPA and a 
bunch of other random functionality that may or 
may not be necessary in prod, but this is all about 
that sweet portfolio cred baby!

I'm using Google App Engine for host, so some of
this will be AppEngine-centric, but really I have
tried to keep it as modular as possible so that 
we can host it wherever and just swap out the 
login widget being served.

The design is simple, serve up a static template
with handlebars.js that contains a login widget.
POST that back and serve up an app of choice i.e.
React, Polymer, Angular, Vue etc... 

I have a submodule in app/app-react that is a 
React app. 

For my next trick I'll fork this repo and implement
a GraphQL API on the BE and use WebComponents on 
the FE. I'll probably do that when I start adding
too much functionality for a sane REST API. 

I would love some feedback on infosec and ways 
that I can improve in general...
